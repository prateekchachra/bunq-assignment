# Bunq Assignment

Create a simple chat app in React. A user must be able to:

- enter a username + password to login
- view one-to-one conversations with other users
- send a new message in a conversation
- new messages appear automatically in the conversation

## Technologies used

- Used Style Components for designing the components
- Used Jest and React Testing Library for Unit Testing
- Used Playwright for E2E testing

### To run the app: `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
